# Eagle_Eye
  # Inspiration
  
  Web3 space has always been a space that thrives on communities. With the rise in mainstream adoption, 
  fortune and non-regulated nature of the space, Web3 space has been largely dominated by scam projects, 
  scam coins and scam communities. The rising need to ensure safer space gave birth to Eagle Eye- 
  a community-based platform that prides in a safer space for veteran , new users and investors of the 
  space while fostering wide-stream adoption, decentralized policing and passive earning. 
  Eagle Eye is a web3 platform with a feel and environment of web2 such that users transitioning from web2 
  to web3 users can already feel at home!
